# AnimationsInAndroid

This is an Android POC to demonstrate animation effects. These animations make use of the fundamental animation framewoks provided by android like **View animations**, **Property animations** etc.

## View Animations

**View animations** are android's built-in animation effects which are produced by basic view properties like alpha, scale, rotation etc. So basically in this type of animation we are altering a views attributes to produce animation effects.

## Property Animations

**Property animations** are highly customizable animations framework. The concept here is to change the attribute values of a view object in accordance with a range of values either linearly or non-linearly.

## Drawable Animations

**Drawable animations** is the most basic form of animation. It is just a motion of series of drawable images to create an animation effect.
